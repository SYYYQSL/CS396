## What do you want the user to feel when using these tools? What mood is this for? What is the user trying to do?

I want them to think this tool is fun and creative.
I want them to use this tool to draw the picture they want.

## Describe your eraser. What does it do?

When using the eraser, it will draw a line that is as the same color as the background.

## Describe your 1st tool. What does it do? How is it used?

When using the first tool to draw, there will be a line of sun follow your mouse and another line of moon will be appear in
other places. I use a lifespan to let moons draw in different direction.

## Describe your 2nd tool. What does it do? How is it used?

When using the second tool to draw, there will be a line of "Spacecraft" follow your mouse.

## Describe your 3rd tool. What does it do? How is it used?

When using the 3rd tool, there will be a line in different color. I use p.random() to let the line change color.

## Describe your 4th tool. What does it do? How is it used?

When using the 4th tool, there will be mutiple curves in different color follow the mouse.

## Which of your tools is continuous? What makes that different?

My line brush is continuous. I use p.random() to let the line change color.
Also my curves brush is continuous. I creat 4 curves and let them change color.

## Which of your tools uses begin/endshape? What are you doing with that feature?

My curves brush uses begin/endshape. The endShape () function in Js is used after the beginShape () function to complete the drawing of the shape. When this function is called, all image data defined after the previous beginShape () function is written to the image buffer to be used as a shape.
