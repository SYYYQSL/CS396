## Describe each of the four GIFs

1. A lovely looping family
2. some circles are doing regular and fast movement
3. Plice are chasing thieves

## What P5 method or technique did you enjoy using the most? What was interesting

to you about it?
I think is P.noise. The random movement is interesting

## Did you find any P5 functionality that wasn't covered in class?

p.textSize() and p.text()

## How did you get your looping gif to loop smoothly? What was hard or easy about

that techinque?
Creat 3 different picture, let them all move, so it looks like a loop
The hardest point is to control the looping time
